### [Introduction to AI]({% post_url 2023-01-21-ai-intro %})

In this module, we will cover the history of AI and the different subfields within AI such as machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics. We will also discuss the current state of AI and its potential future developments.

Problem Solving

This module will cover the different techniques used in AI for problem-solving such as search algorithms, rule-based systems, and decision-making. We will also discuss the different AI architectures such as symbolic AI and sub-symbolic AI.

Search Algorithms

This module will cover the different search algorithms used in AI such as breadth-first search, depth-first search, and best-first search. We will also discuss heuristic search algorithms such as A* and the IDA* algorithm.

Representation of Knowledge

This module will cover the different ways that knowledge can be represented in AI systems such as frames, semantic networks, and production rules.

Reasoning

This module will cover the different reasoning techniques used in AI such as deduction, induction, abduction, and reasoning under uncertainty.

Machine Learning

This module will cover the fundamentals of machine learning, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.

Neural Networks

This module will cover the basics of neural networks, including perceptrons, multi-layer perceptrons, backpropagation, and deep learning, including convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks.

Natural Language Processing

This module will cover the fundamentals of natural language processing, including text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.

Computer Vision

This module will cover the fundamentals of computer vision, including image processing, object detection, and image recognition. Topics such as feature detection and extraction, object tracking, and structure from motion will be discussed.

Robotics

This module will cover the basics of robotics and its applications in AI. Topics such as kinematics, dynamics, control, and planning will be discussed.

Advanced Topics

This module will cover more advanced topics in AI, such as generative models, transfer learning, and reinforcement learning. Topics such as GANs, VAEs, and DRL will be discussed.

Applications

This module will cover the various applications of AI in different domains such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and manufacturing. Real-world applications and case studies will be discussed.

Ethics

This module will cover the ethical considerations and societal implications of AI. Topics such as privacy, security, bias, and transparency will be discussed.


> This is a basic outline of a graduate course in AI, but it's important to note that the curriculum could be adjusted depending on the specific focus of the course and the audience. It's also important to note that this is a theoretical course, and some of the modules should be complemented with practical assignments and projects to make students familiar with programming and implementing AI algorithms.
